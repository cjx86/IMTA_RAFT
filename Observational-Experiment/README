The contents in this folder are the data from each of the sensors that was deployed during the observational experiment at the UNH Aquaculture site in January 2016.

Each subfolder contains the relevant data from the sensor as well as the code to analyze the data and reproduce plots from the thesis. The code has been re-written to run as is in the current folder structure.

Each individual sensor analysis output is saved in the "Data" folder. It is from this folder that the code in the "Combined" reads in data.

The "functions" folder is a series of subroutines that were utilized in various loccations in the code. Many of them are self explanatory in their naming scheme.
