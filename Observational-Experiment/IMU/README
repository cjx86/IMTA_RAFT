The contents in this folder are the data from the IMU computing stack and the code to analyze it. 

The code was originally written to be able to pull directly from the IMU output in the "Data" file and is how it is currently set up to run. 

A secondary option was coded to read in the raw data once and save it as the .mat file, "data_read_from_IMU" and then future executiaons of the code would read from that file to save time.
