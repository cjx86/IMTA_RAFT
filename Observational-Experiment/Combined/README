The contents in this folder combine the outputs from each of the individual sensor codes and uses that data to make comparisons between sensor outputs.

mkRAOs_CS pulls in data (from the "Data" folder in the observational experiment folder) from all of the sensors and compares it.

adcp_LC compares adcp and loadcell data, as those two sensors recorded for a longer period of time than the IMU.
